## ❓ FAQ – Calabreso Edition

### 📘 Can I use it with books in any language?
Absolutely! It works like a charm with any language, the thing is — The extension is not based on Kindle books but Amazon URLs. 
E.g.: **.com / .com.br / .uk**

Just head to [ler.amazon.com.br/notebook](https://ler.amazon.com.br/notebook) or [read.amazon.com/notebook](https://read.amazon.com/notebook) and let the magic happen.
- **P.S. At this moment, the extension was not tested with all available Amazon sub-domains and TLDs.**

### 🧠 Do I need to pay for Notion?
Nope. You can use the free Notion plan. Just create an integration and share your database with it. Easy peasy.

### 🔐 Where do I find my Notion API token?
Go to [Notion Integrations](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations), create one, and grab that sweet “Internal Integration Token.” Paste it into the extension settings.

### 🗂️ How do I find my database ID?
Open your Notion database and check the URL.  
Example:  
`https://www.notion.so/f7979b5axerequinha2f8fa?v=796edexemplokabal79a096`  
→ Your ID is: `f7979b5axerequinha2f8fa`

### 📦 What if my database has more than 100 blocks?
No worries. The extension slices and dices your highlights into batches, respecting Notion’s API limits like a true chef.

### 🧙‍♂️ Do I need to configure anything besides the token and ID?
Yes, capisce. You need to create your notion page/database and set the properties for the book name and author.
You gotta tell the extension the exact names of your database properties for title and author. Like `Título do Livro` and `Autor`.

### 🧪 Can I contribute to this project?
Heck yes! Fork it, tweak it, and send a pull request. Open source is all about community, my friend.
