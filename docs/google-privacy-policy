## 1. Data We Collect

We collect only what’s necessary to export your Kindle highlights and notes to Notion:

- **Kindle Highlights and Notes**: Text, book titles, authors, and cover image URLs from `https://ler.amazon.com.br/notebook` and `https://read.amazon.com/notebook`. Used to transfer your data to Notion.
- **Notion Integration Data**: Your Notion API token and database ID, provided by you. Needed to connect and send data to your Notion account.
- **Technical Data**: Browser version, IP address, and error logs. Helps us improve the extension and fix issues.

We don’t collect personal info (e.g., name or email) unless you share it for support.

## 2. How We Use Your Data

Your data is used solely to:
- Export Kindle highlights and notes to Notion.
- Enhance the extension’s performance and troubleshoot problems.
- Assist you if you reach out for support.

We do **not** use your data for ads or sell it to anyone.

## 3. Data Sharing

We share your data only when essential:
- **With Notion**: To complete the export process via their API.
- **For Legal Reasons**: If required by law or to prevent harm (e.g., fraud).

No other parties get your data—no analytics, no marketers.

## 4. Data Security

We protect your data with:
- **HTTPS**: Secure data transmission to Notion.
- **Local Storage**: Notion API token and database ID stored encrypted in Chrome’s local storage.
- **In-Memory Processing**: Kindle data is processed during export and not saved.

No system is 100% secure, but we take every reasonable step to keep your data safe.

## 5. Web Browsing Activity

We access your browsing **only** on:
- `https://ler.amazon.com.br/notebook`

This is necessary to retrieve your highlights and notes. No other sites are monitored.

## 8. Limited Use Compliance
